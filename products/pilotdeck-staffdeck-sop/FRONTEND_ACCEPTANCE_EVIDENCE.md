# StaffDeck Frontend Acceptance Evidence

This record distinguishes browser/component integration from real service
operations. It was produced against the local formal profile on 2026-09-21.

## Knowledge: Real Isolated Lifecycle

The PilotDeck facade at `http://localhost:13121/api/modules/knowledge/call`
was used with a uniquely named temporary knowledge base. The acceptance run:

1. called `create_base`;
2. called `import_document` and polled `get_job` plus `list_documents` until
   the job was `succeeded` and the document was `ready`;
3. called `update_document`, then `get_document` and verified the updated
   title was returned;
4. called `query` scoped to that base and received one evidence chunk;
5. called `resolve_citation` for that chunk; and
6. called `delete_base` in a `finally` block.

Observed values from the completed run:

| Check | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Temporary base | `kb_22ee86ded9a84478` (cleaned) |
| Import job | `succeeded` |
| Document | `ready` |
| Update/readback | `Acceptance document updated` |
| Query | one evidence chunk |
| Citation | `kchunk_ac88b2807d424426` |

## Knowledge: Real Structure Editing

A second, separately created temporary base completed ingestion and then used
the extracted structure operations:

| Check | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Temporary base | `kb_90d75aa358cb4b02` (cleaned) |
| Import job | `succeeded` |
| Bucket update/read | title `Acceptance bucket` |
| Chunk update/read | summary `Updated chunk summary` and content `Updated cedar-47 chunk content` |

This run used `list_document_buckets`, `update_bucket`, `list_bucket_chunks`,
and `update_chunk` through the same PilotDeck facade.

The browser at `http://localhost:15121/knowledge` was also inspected in
Chinese. It rendered real seeded StaffDeck bases, document state, search, and
the extracted lifecycle/job/structure/OKF/discovery panels.

## SOP: Current Evidence

Portable SOP definitions continue to be exercised through the local
definition facade and Gateway lifecycle. The browser composition now consumes
the formal StaffDeck version-detail dialog slice from the vendored
`@staffdeck/business-ui` release; the focused component test verifies the
dialog fields, serialized node details, and close callback.

The full StaffDeck draft/create/validate/publish/archive/version/rollback page
is intentionally not claimed as shared. No StaffDeck `/api/v1` service with a
scoped `sops:*` credential is configured in this local formal profile, so no
real public SOP management operation is recorded as passed.
